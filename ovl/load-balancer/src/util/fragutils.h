  TCP uses PMTU to avoid fragmentation so fragmentation normally only
  happens for other protocols like UDP.

  About sizes

  It is of course impossible to give a definite answer, but there are
  some things to consider.

  The theoretical max of concurrent fragmented packets is (hsize +
  maxBuckets). But hashing is not perfect so a better estimate is
  (hsize * used% + maxBuckets).  The used% depends on the data and the
  quality of the hash function.

  The larger the hsize, the lower the probablility for collisions and
  therefore better performance. maxBuckets is only needed on hash
  collisions but they may happen even on low usage if we are unlucky.

  Since all packets times out there is a correlation between the
  fragmented packet rate (not the fragment rate) and the size and ttl.

    max-frag-packet-rate = max-packets / ttl-in-seconds

  With this we can make a rough estimate of that hsize is needed for a
  *sustained* rate of fragmented packets;

    hsize = rate * ttl * 5, maxBuckets = hsize / 2

  For ttl=0.2 S, rate=200 pkt/S we get hsize=200, maxBuckets=100
  (with ttl=0.2 we get hsize = rate)

  The constant "5" is more or less taken out of thin air, but this can
  actually be simulated and 5 seem OK, a bit high even

  Fragments out-of-order should be extremely rare. A conservative
  value for maxFragments may be ok. Even 0 (zero) if we don't care.

  MTU is the maximum size of stored fragments. It should be set to the
  MTU size for the ingress device.

  About timeout and GC

  The timeout should be set fairly low, e.g. 200ms. This is a
  fragmented packet we are talking about, not some re-send
  timeout. There is a standard saying 2sec I think, but don't care
  about that. Remember that we never exlpicitly remove anything from
  the fragment table, *everything* is removed by a timeout!

  Fragment entries that has timed out are not automatically
  freed. Instead they are GC'ed when a bucket is re-used. If there are
  no collisions it will always work with no overhead. We have
  optimized for the normal case.

  But if we have got collisions and allocated new bucket structures
  they will linger until next time we happen to hash to that same
  bucket (which may be never). This works well over time since buckets
  will most often be re-used eventually, and in case of high load,
  more frequently.

  However a full GC is trigged by reading the fragmentation stats. So
  it may be prudent to do so from time to time. A reason may be for
  metrics or for an alarm on over-use of stored fragments which may
  indicate a DoS attack.
