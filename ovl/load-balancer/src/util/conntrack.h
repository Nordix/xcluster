  A simple connection/fragment tracker

  Implemented as a hash table with addresses+id or the 5-tuple
  {proto,srcAddr,dstAddr,srcPort,dstPort} as key.

  Bucket allocation

  If there are no hash collisions no buckets are allocated. On a
  collision the user defined "allocBucketFn" is called. It should
  return a pointer to memory of "sizeof_bucket" bytes or NULL. If NULL
  is returned the "ctInsert" will fail and return -1. For protection,
  only a limited ammount of buckets should be allowed (i.e do not
  simply use "malloc(sizeof_bucket)").

  User data handling

  The connection handles (void*) pointers. When a bucket has timed out
  or when "ctRemove" is called the "freeDataFn" is called for the
  data. The user should not free the data until "freeDataFn" is
  called. The "freeDataFn" is only called once for each user data.

  A Garbage Collection procedure is used. User-data for timed out
  buckets is not freed until the bucket is re-used or when "ctStats"
  is called, which trigs a full GC.

  A "lockDataFn" may be specified and will be called on a "ctLookup"
  while the bucket is locked. This can be used for exclusive use when
  multiple threads may call "ctLookup" or "ctRemove". Reference
  counters may be used.
